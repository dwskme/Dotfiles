This is as shell script for automating the installation and customization of my developmetn env.

As for linux i use windows subsysetm for linux so i dont install any major gui programs as most of my work is dont in cli
This script is free and can be downlaoded from github and use as u like
You can very easily install all or req things as i frequently reset my os or when i do fresh install its very much tedious to install and
configure the same thing again and again

There are also other script found in github but mostly was for the dual boot system or the virtual env with proper gui system so i decied
to make my own script for wsl2

Main installation are

1. all req update and upgrades
2. major depedencies and build essentials
3. py git curl
4. vim zsh
5. docker
6. ................

The installation is quite simple and you can also install only specific or all of them for the fully fresh as you like

I am planning to make one more script for the gui system as well but as i currently am not using the gui in virutal env so these may take
some time.s
